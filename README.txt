You will need to install python and scipy to run this software.

See the Examples directory to get started. All of the examples should
run by typing "python examplename.py" at a command prompt. 

I hope you find this code useful, and to that end I have sprinkled
explanatory comments throughout the code.  If you have any questions
or comments, please e-mail me directly at zunzun@zunzun.com.
